- The **List interface** in java is a part of the `java.util` package and is a sub-interface of the collection interface. It provides a way to store an ordered collection of elements (known as a sequence). Lists allow for precise control over where elements are inserted and can contain duplicate elements.
- The **List interface** is implemented by several classes in the Java Collection Framework, such as *ArrayList*, *LinkedList*, *Vector*, and *Stack*.
